## ‚ú® Core Features

Synapse is more than just a chatbot; it's a sophisticated agent designed to solve complex problems by thinking, acting, and learning.

* **üß† Multi-Step Reasoning:** Powered by a custom reasoning loop, the agent can break down complex queries into sequential steps, gather information, and synthesize a final answer.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Real-Time Tool Integration:** Dynamically uses a set of tools to fetch live data from the internet, including:
    * **`getWeather`**: For current weather information.
    * **`getCryptoPrice`**: For real-time cryptocurrency prices.
    * **`getNews`**: For the latest news headlines on any topic.
    * And more utility tools for calculations and time.
* **üöÄ Dynamic & Interactive Frontend:** A modern, visually stunning UI built with:
    * **Spline 3D:** An interactive 3D scene serves as the application background.
    * **GSAP & Framer Motion:** Butter-smooth animations for scroll-based triggers, hover effects, and message streaming.
    * **Glassmorphism Design:** A sleek, frosted-glass aesthetic for a futuristic feel.
* **üîó Full-Stack Architecture:** A clear separation of concerns between the robust backend agent and the modern frontend client.
    * **Backend:** A Node.js/Express API that houses the core agent logic and tool connections.
    * **Frontend:** A multi-page React (Vite) application for a seamless user experience.
